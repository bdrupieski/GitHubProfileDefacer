This project makes fake commits to a git repository following the pattern specified in "pattern.txt". For every period (.) in that file it will make 10 commits, starting on the first full row/week available on the GitHub profile. The letter X is a placeholder and is ignored.

There are other projects that can also do this, like [gitfiti](https://github.com/gelstudios/gitfiti).
